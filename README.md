To run the project a local mongodb database is needed on port "27017". 
The coaches and candidates are seed in the database thanks to JSON files.

I couldn't finished th whole task.
I stopped at the uploading part, you can upload a file but it is stored in "uplaod" repositories.

I wanted to store them in the database and to display the videos names which were already uploaded on their respective coaches and talent pages with the possibility to export them.

I worked with visual code studio.
